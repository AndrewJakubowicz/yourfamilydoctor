Patients of our practice can contact doctors by phone during surgery hours.
It is important for our receptionists to determine the urgency and nature of the call.
In non-urgent situations, patient calls need not interrupt consultations with other patients.
The Nurse will often be able to deal with your query and will triage your call.

If necessary, a message will be left for the Doctor whilst he or she is consulting.
The Doctor will then endeavour to return the call at the end of their session.

However, if the matter is urgent then staff will put the call through immediately to the Nurse or Doctor concerned or to the Doctor on duty.

Emails and SMS messages of a clinical nature will not be accepted by Practitioners of this practice except via the secure Manage My Health messaging facility.
Please speak with the receptionist if you wish to register.
