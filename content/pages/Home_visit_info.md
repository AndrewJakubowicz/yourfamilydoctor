If you are too sick to attend the surgery and you are a regular patient in the **local** areas of the surgeries, a home visit can be arranged by contacting our reception staff.

We also provide care for nursing home and hostel residents as well as hospital patients.

Please contact the surgery before 9.30am to make arrangements.


Standard AMA fees up to $250 may be charged for a Home Visit and are payable at the time of making the appointment. Routine visits to Aged Care facilities and Hostels are generally bulk-billed. We are not a locum service and cannot attend patients who routinely see other doctors.
