We welcome all new patients at both our clinics.

When attending the practice for the first time it would be appreciated if you could arrive 10 minutes before your appointment so we can register your details before you see the doctor.

Please make sure you bring your Medicare card, and your Health care or pension cards. If you do not have a health care or pension card, please bring your banking details or debit card (cheque or savings account) if you have not registered this information with Medicare.

Please also let the receptionist know if you feel you require a long appointment so extra time is allowed for you.
