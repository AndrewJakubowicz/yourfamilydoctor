When making an appointment, please let reception know if you need more time than a standard consultation or if you will be bringing another family member so that an appointment will can be made for them as well.

Longer consultations are usually required for complicated health problems and completing medical and insurance reports.

Patients are seen according to the appointment order, so by advising us beforehand, youâ€™ll help avoid long waiting periods for other patients.

*In the case of an acute illness, particularly a child, please let the receptionist know.*

The practice provides a complete range of medical care, including home visits, hospital and nursing home care. If you are in need of a home visit, please contact the surgery as soon as possible after 8.30am. Fees apply.

## Cancellation Policy

We always endeavour to try and accommodate every patient that calls for an appointment. Thus we request that anyone not able to attend their appointment notify us at least 2 hours prior to the appointment time. This gives us the opportunity to offer this appointment to someone else.

Repeat offences may result in a non-attendance fee for the lost appointment time (not covered by Medicare) or refusal to give further appointments.
