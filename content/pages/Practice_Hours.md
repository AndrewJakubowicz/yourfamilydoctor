## After hours

If your situation seems like an emergency - call **000** immediately, otherwise:

1. If the matter is urgent, such as chest pain, call the ambulance on 000.
    The ambulance should respond much sooner than we can, and every minute may be important.
2. Call us anytime on 1902 260 044 (CHARGES APPLY - $5.50 inc. GST per minute and higher charges may apply from mobile phones and / or payphones).
    You will be connected to one of your clinicsâ€™ doctors and can discuss the situation and decide on the best course of action.
3. Call a locum service such as National Home Doctor Service on 13 SICK (137425) or visit [www.homedoctor.com.au](www.homedoctor.com.au). Both will send us a letter about your visit.
4. Call the After-Hours GP Helpline on **1800 022 222** for free health information and assistance from a registered nurse, or medical advice from a GP if you need it.
5. Attend hospital or wait till the clinic opens - we will do our best to fit you in as soon as possible.
