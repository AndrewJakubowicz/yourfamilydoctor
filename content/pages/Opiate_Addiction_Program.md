We offer a program to help people give up drugs, especially heroin but we can help with any addiction including alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and benzos.

Drug dependence is a complex condition involving social, psychological and biological components. Dependence on opioids is a serious condition associated with severe morbidity and a high risk of death. This risk arises from both drug overdose and the morbidity and injury that result from chronic illicit drug use or misuse of licit opioids. Maintenance pharmacotherapies can be compared to other drugs that are effective in treating serious, chronic, relapsing conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. These conditions, like opioid dependence, are chronic, require daily treatment, and have a high risk of adverse effects if treatment compliance is poor.

Addiction is a chronic brain condition. The addicted brain is distinctly, biologically different from the non-addicted brain.

Please look at the pictures on the Addicted Brain page.

The process is not easy - there may well be problems along the way and relapses are unfortunately quite common. However, even after a few relapses, most people who genuinely want to stop using drugs can succeed. The success rate of getting off heroin with the help of methadone or buprenorphine and counselling is quite good provided you actually want to stop using.

If you don't actually want to stop using heroin, then the program will not work.

Remember that it is YOUR life and YOU must make an effort to get it in order. No-one can do it for you. It means taking RESPONSIBILITY - to get to the chemist, to get scripts on time and to get on with your life including going to work.

## Rules of the Program

Please remember that you will be treated like any other patient provided that you are courteous and punctual. This is a general medical practice not a specialised drug rehab centre and it is important that other patients and staff don't feel threatened. Fights in the waiting room will not be tolerated.

It is your responsibility to make sure that you get the scripts at the appropriate times. Doctors do not have time to fax scripts, or your prescriber may not be on duty on the day, or may even be on holidays (especially during school holidays). Once you are stable, doctors generally write scripts to last at least 2 months. You thus have lots of time to get organised to get the script in time. Do not leave it to the last moment.

Please remember that there are many laws associated with drug use and the methadone / buprenorphine program. Doctors cannot and will not take the risk of having legal problems themselves by going outside what is lawful, whether or not the doctor may personally agree with it.

Waiting lists to join this program are long and consideration is given to those who are really committed to the program.

Non-compliance of the conditions of the program will not be tolerated.

1. Followup appointments to be made directly after last Dr visit
2. Do not expect to walk into the surgery without an appointment and be seen by the doctor (consideration of others).
3. Phone calls and messages with regard to scripts and doses will not be accepted.
4. Lost and or stolen scripts will require another appointment and there is no guarantee of replacement.
1. Routine supervised urine screen is part of the program (3 monthly) or as requested. *This is a legal requirement.*
1. Rudeness and anti social behaviour within the surgery or the surgery grounds will not be tolerated and will result in the instant termination of the program
1. The program is designed to encourage you to take RESPONSIBILITY for yourself by maintaining appointments with doctors, ensuring scripts are current and kept safe. If we feel that you are not serious about the program or non-compliant with requirements, you will be asked to find another prescriber.
1. If you turn up intoxicated, you won't be seen by a doctor.
